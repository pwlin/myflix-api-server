00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:42,440
Hello?

5
00:03:20,915 --> 00:03:23,082
No! No!

6
00:04:56,384 --> 00:04:58,352
What's going on in there?

7
00:04:58,354 --> 00:05:02,422
John own memories are intruding.
He's having a seizure.

8
00:05:02,424 --> 00:05:05,592
Marjorie! Get in there! Now!

00:05:34,992 --> 00:05:37,861
<i>Senator Rockford has been
identified as the target...</i>

10
00:05:37,863 --> 00:05:41,064
<i>of an FBI investigation, involving
embezzlement and accusations of blackmail.</i>

11
00:05:41,066 --> 00:05:42,999
Senator!

12
00:05:43,001 --> 00:05:47,705
I whole heartedly and emphatically deny any
and all allegations leveled against me.

13
00:05:47,707 --> 00:05:50,775
<i>His attorney has secured the
services of Mindscape...</i>

14
00:05:50,777 --> 00:05:53,077
<i>the world's top memory
detective agency...</i>

15
00:05:53,079 --> 00:05:57,449
<i>to gather information about his past and
help the FBI with the investigation.</i>

16
00:05:57,451 --> 00:05:59,851
<i>Memory detectives, as
they're commonly known...</i>

17
00:05:59,853 --> 00:06:02,387
<i>have experienced a resurgence
in recent years...</i>

18
00:06:02,389 --> 00:06:06,625
<i>thanks to the growing number of cases
solved using the remote viewing technique.</i>

19
00:06:06,627 --> 00:06:10,029
<i>In the early 70 s, the
Defense Intelligence Agency</i>

20
00:06:10,031 --> 00:06:14,367
<i>began conducting top secret experiments
with people with psychic abilities</i>

21
00:06:14,369 --> 00:06:18,137
<i>to help gather intelligence
for modern warfare.</i>

22
00:06:18,139 --> 00:06:20,506
<i>They came across a
group of ESP's...</i>

23
00:06:20,508 --> 00:06:22,910
<i>that had the ability to
access people's memories</i>

24
00:06:22,912 --> 00:06:27,414
<i>and observe them as they were experienced
in the past by the subjects.</i>

25
00:06:29,751 --> 00:06:33,053
<i>The findings of memory detectives do
not yet carry the same weight...</i>

26
00:06:33,055 --> 00:06:34,623
<i>as DNA evidence in court...</i>

27
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:38,226
<i>but currently prove more
reliable than polygraph tests.</i>

28
00:06:38,228 --> 00:06:41,463
<i>They say, remote viewing is nothing
more than an elaborate scam...</i>

29
00:06:41,465 --> 00:06:44,966
<i>but the reality is, remote viewers
have been solving cases...</i>

30
00:06:44,968 --> 00:06:46,969
<i>that have been cold for years.</i>

31
00:06:46,971 --> 00:06:50,206
<i>Most recently, the murder of
child actress Kate Henderson...</i>

32
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:52,341
<i>was solved by memory
detective John Washington.</i>

33
00:06:55,445 --> 00:06:57,279
Shit.

34
00:07:02,787 --> 00:07:04,254
Hello?

35
00:07:04,256 --> 00:07:05,622
- <i>Ah, hello!</i>
- <i>Good Morning!</i>

36
00:07:05,624 --> 00:07:07,524
I'm calling about
the house for sale.

37
00:07:07,526 --> 00:07:11,929
No... no... we're not selling
the house anymore, I'm sorry.

38
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:14,799
Well... the agency listing says
it's still active.

39
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:17,902
Yeah, I know it's still listed at the
agency, but we're not selling it, okay?

40
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:19,737
Mr. Washington's own
traumatic memories...

41
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:21,673
<i>were blending in with
his clients memories...</i>

42
00:07:21,675 --> 00:07:22,974
<i>which impaired his ability
to focus during sessions.</i>

43
00:07:22,976 --> 00:07:25,144
And thank you.

44
00:07:25,146 --> 00:07:29,448
<i>Now it seems, Senator Rockford is betting
his political career on Mindscape...</i>

45
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:34,119
<i>the prime memory detective
agency in the world.</i>

46
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:39,659
<i>The rumors that the Mindscape program
is dangerous, are unfounded.</i>

47
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,880
John is here.

48
00:07:59,882 --> 00:08:04,086
John... how are you?

49
00:08:04,088 --> 00:08:06,521
I'm great.

50
00:08:06,523 --> 00:08:08,190
You're still taking the medication?

51
00:08:08,192 --> 00:08:09,558
No, I'm done with all that.

52
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,394
Well, you're lucky
the stroke was mild.

53
00:08:12,396 --> 00:08:15,832
You could be relearning
your abc's right now.

54
00:08:15,834 --> 00:08:18,735
That's true.

55
00:08:18,737 --> 00:08:19,969
Yes?

56
00:08:19,971 --> 00:08:22,972
Uh... I'm good.

57
00:08:22,974 --> 00:08:25,041
Nice.

58
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:31,448
You met anybody recently?

59
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:34,451
You know, John, maybe it's time
to get back in the running.

60
00:08:34,453 --> 00:08:35,986
I'm not there yet.

61
00:08:35,988 --> 00:08:37,321
It's been two years.

62
00:08:37,323 --> 00:08:39,691
You should move on from
what happened to your wife.

63
00:08:41,494 --> 00:08:43,828
And you know it wasn't your fault.

64
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:45,363
Yeah, well...

65
00:08:45,365 --> 00:08:48,199
Oh, shit! Shit! Sorry.

66
00:08:48,201 --> 00:08:50,201
Ah, don't worry about it.
Don't worry!

67
00:08:50,203 --> 00:08:51,771
I'm so sorry.
Don't worry about it.

68
00:08:51,773 --> 00:08:53,405
I'm sorry.

69
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:56,776
Here... sit down!
Sorry.

70
00:08:56,778 --> 00:08:59,178
I heard Senator Rockford on... TV...

71
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:02,815
talking about the possibility
of hiring a memory detective.

72
00:09:02,817 --> 00:09:07,220
Oh, yeah, yeah. Peter Lundgren
is already working on the case.

73
00:09:07,222 --> 00:09:09,623
Rockford hired him.
Lundgren?

74
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:12,826
C'mon! I was better than him
on my worst day!

75
00:09:12,828 --> 00:09:15,428
Yeah, but gifts like
yours need to be used.

76
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:16,998
You've been out of
the game for months.

77
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,401
And Lundgrens' success nowadays
is close to 100 percent.

78
00:09:24,273 --> 00:09:25,740
What's the matter?

79
00:09:29,913 --> 00:09:32,581
To be honest, I'm
running out of money.

80
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:37,119
You still have the beach house?

81
00:09:37,121 --> 00:09:38,220
Yeah.

82
00:09:38,222 --> 00:09:39,555
Go ahead. Sell it.

83
00:09:39,557 --> 00:09:44,027
I'm not ready to sell it yet.

84
00:09:44,029 --> 00:09:47,964
What I was wondering was whether I
could do something for Mindscape.

85
00:09:47,966 --> 00:09:51,668
As it happens, I, uh...

86
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:55,005
I might have something you're
right for, perfect actually.

87
00:09:55,007 --> 00:09:58,275
Her name is Anna.

88
00:09:58,277 --> 00:10:01,245
Oh, you're kidding.

89
00:10:01,247 --> 00:10:04,849
Forget about the name, right?

90
00:10:04,851 --> 00:10:08,186
She used to be my patient
when she was little.

91
00:10:08,188 --> 00:10:10,155
Very special girl...

92
00:10:10,157 --> 00:10:14,426
she's a teenager now, but I don't
think a... a doctor can help.

93
00:10:14,428 --> 00:10:16,428
Maybe a viewer can.

94
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:18,096
Well, what's her problem?

95
00:10:18,098 --> 00:10:21,767
She's on a hunger strike.
All you have to do is get her to eat.

96
00:10:21,769 --> 00:10:24,370
Just tell the parents to
hide the fashion magazines.

97
00:10:24,372 --> 00:10:28,074
John...

98
00:10:28,076 --> 00:10:32,145
You know, it could be a quick one for you,
if you didn't wanna sell the beach house.

99
00:10:49,199 --> 00:10:52,634
<i>Hi John, I'm so happy
you're back in the saddle.</i>

100
00:10:52,636 --> 00:10:55,737
<i>Anna's still refusing to eat,
trying to pressure them...</i>

101
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:57,840
into letting her out of the house.

102
00:10:57,842 --> 00:11:01,944
She's very fragile,
so tread carefully.

103
00:11:01,946 --> 00:11:06,515
<i>Try to find a trauma for her</i>
<i>therapist to work on... bye.</i>

104
00:12:20,696 --> 00:12:23,765
Thank you so much for
working on Anna's case.

105
00:12:23,767 --> 00:12:26,002
I'm Michelle.
John.

106
00:12:26,004 --> 00:12:29,505
And this is Anna's
stepfather, Robert.

107
00:12:29,507 --> 00:12:32,208
Sebastian speaks
very highly of you.

108
00:12:34,578 --> 00:12:37,614
Even as a baby, Anna was unusual.

109
00:12:37,616 --> 00:12:41,918
She didn't smile when you smiled at
her, but she didn't cry much, either.

110
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:47,090
I would say she was unusually
focused for a child, always calm.

111
00:12:47,092 --> 00:12:50,428
She looked at things as if she
already knew what they were.

112
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:56,401
Later, of course, we took her to a specialist,
and her IQ score came back off the charts.

113
00:12:56,403 --> 00:12:58,636
When was the last time she ate?

114
00:12:58,638 --> 00:13:00,405
She stopped eating one week ago.

115
00:13:00,407 --> 00:13:04,543
She's taking vitamins and
drinking water, but nothing else.

116
00:13:04,545 --> 00:13:09,882
In my opinion, she should be... in a
place that can provide the proper care.

117
00:13:09,884 --> 00:13:13,052
I'm sure Anna can get better here.

118
00:13:13,054 --> 00:13:15,922
Mr. Washington, ah... as I'm
sure you can appreciate...

119
00:13:15,924 --> 00:13:18,558
this is a matter that
requires great discretion.

120
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,860
I will need you to sign a
non-disclosure contract...

121
00:13:20,862 --> 00:13:25,999
that anything revealed in Anna's memories can't
be disseminated beyond Michelle and myself.

122
00:13:26,001 --> 00:13:27,334
Of course.

123
00:13:27,336 --> 00:13:32,039
Anna is so special, she's
so many talents, she's...

124
00:13:34,276 --> 00:13:36,077
Gifted.

125
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,012
Yes, gifted.

126
00:13:39,615 --> 00:13:41,983
I think there are
better words for it.

127
00:13:41,985 --> 00:13:44,052
Such as?

128
00:13:44,054 --> 00:13:46,688
I would say haunted.

129
00:13:51,862 --> 00:13:54,497
What happened to
Anna's real father?

130
00:13:54,499 --> 00:13:57,366
He died... when I was pregnant.

131
00:13:57,368 --> 00:13:58,468
Oh, I'm sorry.

132
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,436
Does Anna get along with Robert?

133
00:14:00,438 --> 00:14:04,541
Not well, lately... but he's
tried to do his best for her.

134
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:07,411
I see.
This way.

135
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:11,415
Is there any specific reason
why Anna is refusing to eat?

136
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:13,851
She wants to go back to school,
but that's impossible.

137
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:17,122
I'm sure Sebastian told you
about her cutting herself.

138
00:14:17,124 --> 00:14:20,191
We've had to remove all sharp
objects from her room.

139
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:22,193
We need to protect her.

140
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:25,463
From what?

141
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:28,266
To protect her, from herself.

142
00:14:47,321 --> 00:14:49,923
Sweetie. This is John...

143
00:14:49,925 --> 00:14:52,559
the gentleman I told you
was coming to visit.

144
00:14:52,561 --> 00:14:55,396
Aren't you late for
your AA meeting, Mom?

145
00:15:12,515 --> 00:15:14,383
Can I have a seat?
Can I have a seat?

146
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:19,656
Do you mind?
Do you mind?

147
00:15:19,658 --> 00:15:23,893
We won't guess the next one for sure,
so go ahead, make yourself comfortable.

148
00:15:27,831 --> 00:15:30,500
That's quite the party
trick you have there.

149
00:15:45,318 --> 00:15:48,286
What's the metronome for?

150
00:15:48,288 --> 00:15:51,456
I like the rhythm when I draw.
It's soothing.

151
00:15:58,432 --> 00:16:00,099
Better?

152
00:16:00,101 --> 00:16:01,467
Much.

153
00:16:05,772 --> 00:16:08,842
Anna, you know what catabolysis is?

154
00:16:08,844 --> 00:16:11,044
If you don't eat, your
organs are gonna fail.

155
00:16:11,046 --> 00:16:13,714
John, do you know what "prana" is?

156
00:16:13,716 --> 00:16:16,917
It's sanskrit, it means vital life.

157
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:19,119
There are Yogis in
India who rarely eat.

158
00:16:19,121 --> 00:16:22,624
They get all their energy or
"prana" from the air and the sun.

159
00:16:22,626 --> 00:16:24,459
Is that what you're doing?

160
00:16:24,461 --> 00:16:25,827
Are you a doctor?

161
00:16:25,829 --> 00:16:28,496
No, but I do have to ask
you some questions.

162
00:16:33,903 --> 00:16:39,308
I would like you to tell me
what expression you see.

163
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:44,280
What am I getting in exchange for
making you earn some of Robert's money?

164
00:16:44,282 --> 00:16:47,384
Well, you might get to
know yourself better.

165
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:54,391
What do you see?

166
00:16:58,129 --> 00:17:00,531
Malice.

167
00:17:03,869 --> 00:17:06,270
I'm kidding.

168
00:17:06,272 --> 00:17:08,973
He's expressing happiness,
maybe even affection.

169
00:17:11,744 --> 00:17:13,578
What about this guy?

170
00:17:15,548 --> 00:17:17,683
That guy's pissed off.

171
00:17:17,685 --> 00:17:19,484
Uh-huh.

172
00:17:21,587 --> 00:17:24,057
What about her?

173
00:17:27,194 --> 00:17:29,996
I think her husband's out late,
and she's wondering where he is.

174
00:17:29,998 --> 00:17:33,833
She's worried he's with someone else, but
she's also glad to have the down time...

175
00:17:33,835 --> 00:17:36,002
'cause he's a loser.

176
00:17:40,575 --> 00:17:42,409
Right.

177
00:17:43,945 --> 00:17:46,347
I'm gonna tell you a story...

178
00:17:46,349 --> 00:17:50,218
and then I'm gonna ask you
a question. Okay?

179
00:17:52,555 --> 00:17:56,124
There's this girl about your
age at her mother's funeral.

180
00:17:56,126 --> 00:18:00,428
At the funeral, she sees this
guy she's never seen before.

181
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:02,331
She gets to meet him, briefly.

182
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:05,935
And she thinks he's amazing.
He's everything she's ever wanted.

183
00:18:05,937 --> 00:18:08,971
She falls in love with
him, right there and then.

184
00:18:08,973 --> 00:18:12,341
But, in the crowds at the
funeral, she gets separated...

185
00:18:12,343 --> 00:18:17,080
from him before she has a
chance to ask for his number.

186
00:18:17,082 --> 00:18:21,451
And two days later... this
girl... kills her own sister.

187
00:18:23,254 --> 00:18:26,089
What's her motive for
killing her sister?

188
00:18:30,529 --> 00:18:33,965
Her motive is she wants
to meet the guy again.

189
00:18:38,103 --> 00:18:40,272
Did I get it right?

190
00:18:40,274 --> 00:18:44,410
Oh, there's no right answer.

191
00:18:47,046 --> 00:18:49,481
Depends on what you're looking for.

192
00:18:49,483 --> 00:18:51,283
Why is that?

193
00:18:51,285 --> 00:18:55,522
You're testing me to see if
I think like a sociopath.

194
00:18:55,524 --> 00:18:58,758
Sociopaths sometimes have trouble
reading facial expressions.

195
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:02,028
With the second test, I gave you
the answer you were looking for...

196
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:04,765
but, the fact is, that
story has a flawed set up.

197
00:19:04,767 --> 00:19:07,701
The more logical outcome would be
for the girl to kill her father.

198
00:19:09,471 --> 00:19:12,373
Why?

199
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:15,609
If the girl didn't know the man,
it's unlikely her sister would.

200
00:19:15,611 --> 00:19:19,147
And it was her mother's funeral
where she met this guy...

201
00:19:19,149 --> 00:19:20,849
so it would make more sense
for her to kill her father.

202
00:19:20,851 --> 00:19:23,685
There would be a higher
probability that the...

203
00:19:23,687 --> 00:19:27,355
the mystery stud would
attend her father's funeral.

204
00:19:30,093 --> 00:19:32,395
That's probably true.

205
00:19:32,397 --> 00:19:35,765
I'm not a sociopath, just smart
enough to think like one.

206
00:19:42,106 --> 00:19:44,475
Can I see what you're drawing?

207
00:19:54,854 --> 00:19:58,356
If you're not a doctor,
then what are you?

208
00:19:58,358 --> 00:20:02,227
I take people to their memories.

209
00:20:11,771 --> 00:20:13,339
She's monitored all the time?

210
00:20:13,341 --> 00:20:15,608
24-7.

211
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:19,813
If you need anything while you're here, you
can ask me or Ralph, we both watch Anna.

212
00:20:19,815 --> 00:20:21,114
I'm John.

213
00:20:21,116 --> 00:20:24,384
Oh, I'm Judith... this is my cell.

214
00:20:24,386 --> 00:20:27,721
Call me, if you can't
make a session.

215
00:20:27,723 --> 00:20:29,322
I will.

216
00:20:38,233 --> 00:20:40,701
You were right about
her, she's smart.

217
00:20:40,703 --> 00:20:44,072
Special kid, lots of problems.

218
00:20:44,074 --> 00:20:47,809
What do you think are
the underlying issues?

219
00:20:47,811 --> 00:20:52,514
Depression, bipolar disorder
with deep-seeded narcissism.

220
00:20:52,516 --> 00:20:56,586
I'm gonna need her full file to
know what memories to target.

221
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:58,988
Parents don't want full disclosure.

222
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:01,524
What? Why? I signed an agreement!

223
00:21:01,526 --> 00:21:05,061
She's been in and out of boarding
schools, involved in some incidents...

224
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:07,063
but you don't need
to get into that.

225
00:21:07,065 --> 00:21:09,233
Just let her take
the lead, you know?

226
00:21:09,235 --> 00:21:12,836
I mean... a few memories where
the parents screw up.

227
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:17,408
As you know, usually, the dramatic experience
of actually going back into memories...

228
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:22,013
affects people, gives them perspective
on their present lives...

229
00:21:22,015 --> 00:21:25,317
to stop overeating, stop
smoking... whatever.

230
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:28,420
Make her eat. Simple case.

231
00:21:38,732 --> 00:21:40,399
Will I know I'm in a memory?

232
00:21:40,401 --> 00:21:43,603
It should feel like it's
happening for the first time...

233
00:21:43,605 --> 00:21:46,974
but it'll be different
from the original event.

234
00:21:46,976 --> 00:21:51,678
Because your unconscious mind will
know that you've been there before.

235
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,580
Also...

236
00:21:53,582 --> 00:21:56,650
me being there makes it different.

237
00:21:58,252 --> 00:22:02,457
The equipment is useful
to record the session.

238
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:16,672
I will be watching you
for the whole time.

239
00:22:16,674 --> 00:22:21,043
If anything happens, I can bring
you back, right away. Okay?

240
00:22:21,045 --> 00:22:24,914
Now, you may see me in the distance,
but you won't know that it's me.

241
00:22:24,916 --> 00:22:28,752
If I'm next to you, you won't
be able to see me at all...

242
00:22:28,754 --> 00:22:30,020
unless I call you back.

243
00:22:30,022 --> 00:22:31,988
Understand?

244
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:34,190
Yes.

245
00:22:34,192 --> 00:22:37,328
Please put these in your ears.

246
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:40,665
They conceal a tone,
hidden in white noise.

247
00:22:40,667 --> 00:22:43,434
It enables the brain to
go into a theta state.

248
00:22:43,436 --> 00:22:45,636
Can we use my metronome as well?

249
00:22:45,638 --> 00:22:47,738
Uh... sure.

250
00:22:53,579 --> 00:22:55,847
Where are we going?

251
00:22:55,849 --> 00:22:57,582
Focus on your first memory.

252
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:59,751
The further back we
can go, the better.

253
00:23:02,022 --> 00:23:03,890
Give me your hands.

254
00:23:07,394 --> 00:23:09,328
Relax.

255
00:23:10,164 --> 00:23:13,032
Think about that first memory.

256
00:23:13,034 --> 00:23:16,470
At first, your memories will
jump around, but that's okay.

257
00:23:26,181 --> 00:23:28,116
When you're ready...

258
00:23:28,118 --> 00:23:29,417
close your eyes.

259
00:23:47,938 --> 00:23:50,940
Let's begin...

260
00:23:57,115 --> 00:23:58,482
now.

261
00:23:58,484 --> 00:24:00,417
I like you being here with us...

262
00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:02,686
We all know you like girls.

263
00:24:05,124 --> 00:24:07,291
She's just a girl for god sakes!

264
00:24:07,293 --> 00:24:08,793
We have a responsibility!

265
00:24:08,795 --> 00:24:10,027
Let me out!

266
00:24:10,029 --> 00:24:12,363
She needs to be in an institution!

267
00:24:12,365 --> 00:24:14,665
She's my daughter!

268
00:24:19,472 --> 00:24:23,242
This old man, he played three.

269
00:24:23,244 --> 00:24:26,411
He played knick-knack on my knee.

270
00:24:26,413 --> 00:24:28,714
With a knick-knack paddy whack...

271
00:24:28,716 --> 00:24:30,450
give a dog a bone...

272
00:24:30,452 --> 00:24:34,420
this old man came rolling home.

273
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:54,342
What game are you playing, honey?

274
00:24:54,344 --> 00:24:56,678
Can I play with you?

275
00:25:00,483 --> 00:25:02,717
You have to be quiet.

276
00:25:06,456 --> 00:25:08,658
What are you up to?

277
00:25:12,463 --> 00:25:15,398
Mommy's not feeling well today.

278
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,633
You can't do that!
You can't just...

279
00:25:17,635 --> 00:25:20,604
We have to think about Anna.
Anna is the focus of the attention.

280
00:25:20,606 --> 00:25:22,406
Don't you think I'm
thinking about her?

281
00:25:22,408 --> 00:25:25,075
We have a responsibility!
We are not the right people!

282
00:25:25,077 --> 00:25:27,377
This is not the place
for her, Michelle!

283
00:25:40,659 --> 00:25:44,029
Come with me, young lady! Dad!
Let me down!

284
00:25:47,034 --> 00:25:50,636
I'll let you out when you realize
that spying on people is wrong.

285
00:25:50,638 --> 00:25:52,338
For god's sakes, She's only a girl!

286
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:54,106
She's different, Michelle.

287
00:25:54,108 --> 00:25:57,911
She's not like other children, she
needs to be in an institution.

288
00:26:02,083 --> 00:26:05,285
Well, why isn't it here, then?
Because I put it in here.

289
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:09,891
She's my daughter.

290
00:26:09,893 --> 00:26:13,261
She tried to stab you,
for Christ's sakes!

291
00:26:13,263 --> 00:26:14,729
Mom!

292
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,135
And coming back... now.

293
00:26:23,974 --> 00:26:25,841
Ow.

294
00:26:25,843 --> 00:26:28,010
Are you okay?

295
00:26:28,012 --> 00:26:29,511
You were there?

296
00:26:29,513 --> 00:26:31,680
I was right next to you.

297
00:26:31,682 --> 00:26:34,484
Spooky.

298
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,353
Can we do more?

299
00:26:37,355 --> 00:26:38,955
Next time.

300
00:26:44,929 --> 00:26:50,668
Self-involved, emotionally stunted retards
is what one hopes for in parents.

301
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:52,970
Did you see the letter opener?

302
00:26:52,972 --> 00:26:55,072
I did.

303
00:26:55,074 --> 00:26:58,742
Maybe my stepdad is the one you should
be testing for personality disorders.

304
00:26:58,744 --> 00:27:01,613
Is he why you're on
a hunger strike?

305
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:10,021
So you married?

306
00:27:10,023 --> 00:27:12,224
I was.

307
00:27:12,226 --> 00:27:14,794
What was her name?

308
00:27:14,796 --> 00:27:16,028
Same as yours.

309
00:27:18,932 --> 00:27:21,000
I like her already.

310
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:24,705
Show me a picture.

311
00:27:24,707 --> 00:27:27,174
I don't carry one anymore.

312
00:27:27,176 --> 00:27:29,443
C'mon, John.

313
00:27:29,445 --> 00:27:32,746
A guy like you always has
a picture in his wallet.

314
00:27:32,748 --> 00:27:34,748
I'll show you a picture...

315
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:36,985
if you agree to eat something.

316
00:27:41,056 --> 00:27:43,958
You wanna see her?

317
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:46,094
It's up to you.

318
00:27:54,537 --> 00:27:56,271
Robert desperately
wants to put me away.

319
00:27:56,273 --> 00:27:59,942
And something like LSD in my
food would make me act crazy.

320
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:04,014
Well then, let's flip out together.

321
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:06,149
If I start hallucinating,
you'll demand a drug test...

322
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:08,651
before they lock me away
in a padded room, right?

323
00:28:08,653 --> 00:28:11,121
I swear.

324
00:28:11,123 --> 00:28:12,856
C mon, let's eat!

325
00:28:26,939 --> 00:28:28,907
She's pretty.

326
00:28:38,051 --> 00:28:41,521
<i>Eat slowly so you don't
make yourself sick.</i>

327
00:28:45,459 --> 00:28:50,730
Why do you wanna see this
antique letter opener?

328
00:28:50,732 --> 00:28:54,334
I like to confirm memories,
just to be sure.

329
00:28:54,336 --> 00:28:56,737
I cut her accidentally.

330
00:28:57,572 --> 00:28:59,840
It's always haunted me.

331
00:29:01,509 --> 00:29:03,577
Is your husband here?
Mm-hm.

332
00:29:03,579 --> 00:29:06,081
Can I talk to you both?

333
00:29:06,083 --> 00:29:08,049
Why?

334
00:29:08,051 --> 00:29:11,719
Anna just started to eat.

335
00:29:11,721 --> 00:29:13,822
So, will I see you at
7:00 to celebrate?

336
00:29:13,824 --> 00:29:16,124
Okay, shall I pick you up then?

337
00:29:16,126 --> 00:29:18,094
Sure, why not?

338
00:29:18,096 --> 00:29:20,162
But only one drink.

339
00:29:50,229 --> 00:29:52,296
So you like being a nurse?

340
00:29:52,298 --> 00:29:54,032
I like helping people.

341
00:29:54,034 --> 00:29:56,502
You take your job
quite seriously, huh?

342
00:29:56,504 --> 00:30:00,205
Well, if you can't do what you love, then
at least make sure you love what you do.

343
00:30:00,207 --> 00:30:01,707
Isn't that what they say?

344
00:30:01,709 --> 00:30:05,344
They do say that, that
is absolutely true.

345
00:30:08,082 --> 00:30:10,783
I think you're doing a
great job with Anna.

346
00:30:10,785 --> 00:30:14,120
Thank you for your confidence.

347
00:30:14,122 --> 00:30:17,323
Sometimes I don't think I'm
gonna be able to help her.

348
00:30:17,325 --> 00:30:18,892
Why?

349
00:30:21,429 --> 00:30:23,864
My wife and I had a baby boy...

350
00:30:23,866 --> 00:30:27,301
who died a few months
after he was born.

351
00:30:27,303 --> 00:30:34,309
My wife kept wanting to go back to the
time when he was still alive, and...

352
00:30:34,311 --> 00:30:36,878
eventually the time came when...

353
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:41,082
she wasn't happy unless
she was in the memory.

354
00:30:41,084 --> 00:30:43,185
She became obsessed.

355
00:30:43,187 --> 00:30:48,090
So, I refused to take her
to the past anymore.

356
00:30:48,092 --> 00:30:54,997
She... spiraled downward, she...
became depressed and I lost her.

357
00:30:57,268 --> 00:31:00,337
I couldn't help her.

358
00:31:00,339 --> 00:31:05,576
I tried to keep her in the house,
but you can't lock someone up...

359
00:31:05,578 --> 00:31:08,412
just because of your own fears.

360
00:31:20,092 --> 00:31:21,259
I had a great time.

361
00:31:21,261 --> 00:31:22,661
Me, too.

362
00:31:22,663 --> 00:31:25,197
I hope I didn't talk too much.
Oh, you did...

363
00:31:25,199 --> 00:31:26,999
but I liked it.

364
00:31:27,001 --> 00:31:28,867
Thank you.

365
00:31:28,869 --> 00:31:33,907
So, you're not even gonna try
to come up, so I can say no?

366
00:31:33,909 --> 00:31:35,709
Uh...

367
00:31:39,013 --> 00:31:42,015
I gotta go.

368
00:31:42,017 --> 00:31:43,850
Safe home.

369
00:31:52,361 --> 00:31:55,329
It's not your fault, John!

370
00:31:57,866 --> 00:32:00,402
It's not your fault, John!

371
00:32:09,213 --> 00:32:11,848
I'm telling you, Sebastian,
I saw her last night.

372
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:14,117
That's impossible.

373
00:32:14,119 --> 00:32:16,719
<i>She's under lock and key,
never allowed to leave her room.</i>

374
00:32:16,721 --> 00:32:19,489
I know, but I... I know what I saw.

375
00:32:19,491 --> 00:32:22,558
<i>Do you, John?
Is everything all right?</i>

376
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,626
Everything's fine.

377
00:32:50,857 --> 00:32:54,760
We may have one, because
there are blind spots.

378
00:32:54,762 --> 00:32:56,662
What's happened?

379
00:32:56,664 --> 00:32:59,165
Anna pushed Judith down the stairs.

380
00:32:59,167 --> 00:33:02,969
Judith is in the hospital
with multiple fractures.

381
00:33:04,505 --> 00:33:06,039
Look at this.

382
00:33:08,142 --> 00:33:12,079
Oh, my god!

383
00:33:12,081 --> 00:33:14,449
There's no other angle at
the top of the stairs?

384
00:33:14,451 --> 00:33:18,052
Blind spot.

385
00:33:18,054 --> 00:33:20,755
On Monday, Anna will be
confined to an institution...

386
00:33:20,757 --> 00:33:23,391
that can properly
address her needs.

387
00:33:23,393 --> 00:33:29,531
Fortunately, as a family friend, Judith
will not be pressing any charges.

388
00:33:29,533 --> 00:33:31,567
I didn't do it, John.

389
00:33:31,569 --> 00:33:34,169
Then why would Judith say you did?

390
00:33:34,171 --> 00:33:36,505
Judith always sneaks
back in late at night.

391
00:33:36,507 --> 00:33:39,776
Mom's knocked-out on sleeping pills,
and that's when they have sex.

392
00:33:39,778 --> 00:33:43,012
Who? Robert and Judith?

393
00:33:43,014 --> 00:33:46,182
He always sleeps with the good
looking help. Just ask Jaime.

394
00:33:46,184 --> 00:33:48,017
I mean, you saw what she was doing
with Robert in the library.

395
00:33:48,019 --> 00:33:51,655
I don't believe you.

396
00:33:51,657 --> 00:33:54,859
When she first came here,
Judith had tried to make friends with me.

397
00:33:54,861 --> 00:33:56,694
And she was all like,
"I have no luck with men".

398
00:33:56,696 --> 00:33:58,195
Well, my stepfather moved right in.

399
00:33:58,197 --> 00:34:00,431
You know, maybe... maybe they
had a fight, it got violent...

400
00:34:00,433 --> 00:34:02,400
and now they're trying to cover it
up by blaming it on the sick girl.

401
00:34:02,402 --> 00:34:04,603
Or maybe Robert just
cold-bloodedly pushed her, okay?

402
00:34:04,605 --> 00:34:07,606
This is exactly the kind of thing
he's been hoping for to lock me up.

403
00:34:07,608 --> 00:34:08,907
Oh, c'mon, Anna.

404
00:34:08,909 --> 00:34:10,542
Open your eyes, John!

405
00:34:10,544 --> 00:34:13,845
My mother's family is one
of the richest in America.

406
00:34:13,847 --> 00:34:16,381
And Robert's on an allowance.

407
00:34:16,383 --> 00:34:20,887
If I die, the money goes to a
charitable trust and he gets zilch.

408
00:34:20,889 --> 00:34:22,755
But if I'm committed...

409
00:34:22,757 --> 00:34:25,925
I get the money,
but I have no rights.

410
00:34:25,927 --> 00:34:27,994
Robert controls every penny.

411
00:34:27,996 --> 00:34:30,130
And I'm sure Judith knows this.

412
00:34:30,132 --> 00:34:33,734
Maybe he was afraid that she was gonna tell
you and that you'd find out his secret plans.

413
00:34:33,736 --> 00:34:37,237
And I'm sure he told you, only moments ago,
that they send me to an institution on Monday.

414
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:38,739
Am I right?

415
00:34:38,741 --> 00:34:42,076
Please, John, you have to help
me prove that I'm innocent.

416
00:34:42,078 --> 00:34:45,447
You're the only person
they're gonna trust.

417
00:34:45,449 --> 00:34:47,682
I... I can't get send away to a
mental institution.

418
00:34:47,684 --> 00:34:49,317
I won't survive that.

419
00:34:49,319 --> 00:34:52,120
I know... I know I'm different,
not like other girls...

420
00:34:52,122 --> 00:34:54,723
but doesn't mean I'm a murderer.

421
00:34:54,725 --> 00:34:57,893
I don't even... I don't even think of doing
half the things they're accusing me of!

422
00:34:57,895 --> 00:34:59,628
Please, John!

423
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:02,998
Help me figure out what the
hell's going on with me.

424
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,301
I mean, you're all I have.

425
00:35:39,772 --> 00:35:41,373
John.

426
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:44,277
How do you feel?

427
00:35:45,613 --> 00:35:48,181
Pretty out of it.

428
00:35:48,183 --> 00:35:53,186
Judith, did you see...
Anna push you down the stairs?

429
00:35:54,288 --> 00:35:56,557
Are you here for Anna or for me?

430
00:35:56,559 --> 00:35:59,059
I'm here for you.

431
00:35:59,061 --> 00:36:00,594
But I need to know what happened.

432
00:36:02,063 --> 00:36:05,699
I know I went to
bring her some food.

433
00:36:07,502 --> 00:36:11,573
I thought I locked the door.

434
00:36:11,575 --> 00:36:14,609
Why don't you go to my memory?

435
00:36:17,013 --> 00:36:22,251
Ah... doesn't work like that.

436
00:36:22,253 --> 00:36:25,288
How do you know it wasn't Robert?

437
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:27,023
Robert?

438
00:36:27,891 --> 00:36:29,959
Judith, I know.

439
00:36:29,961 --> 00:36:32,695
Know what?

440
00:36:32,697 --> 00:36:35,999
I know about you and Robert.

441
00:36:36,001 --> 00:36:39,069
Did he hit on me?

442
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:43,206
Whatever, doesn't matter.

443
00:36:43,208 --> 00:36:47,078
There's nothing going on
between me and Robert.

444
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:54,052
Look, I...

445
00:36:56,188 --> 00:36:58,222
I hope you get better soon.

446
00:37:08,902 --> 00:37:11,671
I can't believe that
Anna would hurt Judith.

447
00:37:11,673 --> 00:37:13,840
Can you help my daughter, John?

448
00:37:13,842 --> 00:37:15,875
I believe I can, Mrs. Greene.

449
00:37:15,877 --> 00:37:19,946
I can take her to her traumatic memories,
help her understand her behavior.

450
00:37:21,083 --> 00:37:22,616
And I wanna find out the truth.

451
00:37:22,618 --> 00:37:25,686
My husband wants to send her to
a professional care facility.

452
00:37:25,688 --> 00:37:28,556
I don't want that, but he's already
paid the registration fee...

453
00:37:28,558 --> 00:37:30,558
and they're expecting
her in a week.

454
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:35,529
As soon as I see that file, I'll
know what I should be looking for.

455
00:37:35,531 --> 00:37:39,534
I'll have Sebastian's assistant
send it to you right away.

456
00:37:39,536 --> 00:37:41,837
Sebastian has it?

457
00:37:45,175 --> 00:37:48,777
<i>You'll see why the family didn't
want you to see the file.</i>

458
00:37:48,779 --> 00:37:50,313
<i>It's strong stuff, John.</i>

459
00:37:50,315 --> 00:37:52,348
You said this was a simple case.

460
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:54,283
<i>And it should have been, John.</i>

461
00:37:54,285 --> 00:37:56,753
Maybe you're not
ready to come back.

462
00:37:56,755 --> 00:37:59,455
Look... they're gonna put Anna
in an institution.

463
00:37:59,457 --> 00:38:02,993
If you'd sent me the file earlier,
maybe I could have prevented all this.

464
00:38:02,995 --> 00:38:06,830
<i>Are you sure you want to
continue with the case?</i>

465
00:38:06,832 --> 00:38:08,899
I'm Anna's best hope right now.

466
00:38:08,901 --> 00:38:12,603
I'll call you in a couple of days.

467
00:38:53,148 --> 00:38:55,583
<i>Do you know why you're here, Anna?</i>

468
00:38:55,585 --> 00:38:57,852
That's pretty obvious.

469
00:38:57,854 --> 00:39:01,222
<i>For just one day, can we talk</i>
<i>about something other than me?</i>

470
00:39:01,224 --> 00:39:04,526
<i>What made you try to kill yourself?</i>

471
00:39:04,528 --> 00:39:06,695
Red...

472
00:39:06,697 --> 00:39:09,298
<i>it's such a dark, rich color.</i>

473
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:12,234
<i>Particular shade,
it's hard to come by.</i>

474
00:39:14,738 --> 00:39:17,674
<i>Blood... it's red.</i>

475
00:39:17,676 --> 00:39:19,309
It's kind of beautiful.

476
00:39:19,311 --> 00:39:22,512
<i>Can you tell me about your
relationship with your parents?</i>

477
00:39:22,514 --> 00:39:27,150
<i>My mother's trying harder, I suppose,
but it's still pretty pathetic.</i>

478
00:39:27,152 --> 00:39:32,490
<i>Her heart's like... one of those fancy
ice sculptures they have at parties.</i>

479
00:39:32,492 --> 00:39:36,127
<i>Do you really want to know the answer?</i>
<i>Please.</i>

480
00:39:36,129 --> 00:39:40,264
It's my parents who
are crazy... not me.

481
00:39:44,570 --> 00:39:49,341
<i>Did you have feelings for your teacher?
Mr. Tatum?</i>

482
00:39:49,343 --> 00:39:52,277
<i>That school was depressing.</i>
<i>He was nice.</i>

483
00:39:52,279 --> 00:39:54,280
Did he take pictures of you?

484
00:39:54,282 --> 00:39:55,649
<i>Would you mind if I
take a picture of you?</i>

485
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:56,883
<i>Yes.</i>

486
00:39:56,885 --> 00:39:59,018
<i>What kind of pictures?</i>

487
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:01,354
Artistic photos.

488
00:40:08,129 --> 00:40:12,132
It was like a Jackson
Pollock painting...

489
00:40:12,134 --> 00:40:14,868
where the blood sprayed
across the floor.

490
00:40:17,772 --> 00:40:21,242
I can still see the exact
pattern when I close my eyes.

491
00:40:21,244 --> 00:40:24,145
<i>Do you want to die, Anna?</i>

492
00:40:24,147 --> 00:40:26,581
Don't we all die in the end?

493
00:40:28,017 --> 00:40:29,250
It's kind of a freedom.

494
00:40:29,252 --> 00:40:31,152
There are other ways to be free.

495
00:40:31,154 --> 00:40:34,023
Not if you're not
allowed to have it.

496
00:40:34,025 --> 00:40:36,659
Then what do you do?

497
00:41:01,486 --> 00:41:03,521
Will you lift your chin a bit?

498
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:11,029
How do you feel when you draw?

499
00:41:11,031 --> 00:41:14,132
Like the whole world disappears.

500
00:41:14,134 --> 00:41:17,202
Like nothing else matters.

501
00:41:17,204 --> 00:41:19,104
All right, finished.

502
00:41:19,106 --> 00:41:20,138
Can I see it?

503
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:24,177
Not yet.

504
00:41:24,179 --> 00:41:25,578
Can I have your bag?

505
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:35,155
Promise me you'll look
at it when you get home?

506
00:41:35,157 --> 00:41:36,957
I promise.

507
00:41:36,959 --> 00:41:39,894
Are we even now?

508
00:41:39,896 --> 00:41:41,195
Can we start the session?

509
00:41:41,197 --> 00:41:43,530
Yeah, we can.

510
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:56,011
Mousey?
It's extremely dangerous.

511
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:57,913
My real name is Megan Scanlon.

512
00:41:57,915 --> 00:42:00,283
Had sex with your teacher?

513
00:42:00,285 --> 00:42:02,018
Who you raping, bitch?

514
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:33,551
Hi, I'm Mousey.

515
00:42:37,057 --> 00:42:40,092
Mousey?
That's really your name?

516
00:42:40,094 --> 00:42:41,627
It's what the people here call me.

517
00:42:41,629 --> 00:42:45,264
My real name is
Megan, Megan Scanlon.

518
00:42:45,266 --> 00:42:47,032
So Susan Merricks your roommate.

519
00:42:47,034 --> 00:42:48,969
What's she really like?

520
00:42:48,971 --> 00:42:51,738
I heard she was training for the
Olympics, had a nervous breakdown...

521
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:53,573
beat up a horse or something.

522
00:42:53,575 --> 00:42:57,877
Oh, great!
Frigid and Mousey are here.

523
00:42:57,879 --> 00:43:00,547
Look, just because I've been
assigned to watch over you...

524
00:43:00,549 --> 00:43:04,919
doesn't mean you have to be in
the room all the time, Frigid.

525
00:43:04,921 --> 00:43:06,354
Name's Anna.

526
00:43:06,356 --> 00:43:10,224
Capital A, N, N, A.

527
00:43:10,226 --> 00:43:13,761
Leave.

528
00:43:13,763 --> 00:43:15,097
Now.

529
00:43:19,802 --> 00:43:23,305
Or maybe the reason you won't go is
because you wanna watch me changing.

530
00:43:23,307 --> 00:43:25,774
Right, Frigid?

531
00:43:29,713 --> 00:43:32,915
What are you doing?
No! No! No! Please don't!

532
00:43:32,917 --> 00:43:34,951
No! No! No! Stop!

533
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:45,562
Cameras will be locked up, and can only
be signed out for a day at a time.

534
00:43:49,801 --> 00:43:53,038
The chemicals you will be
using could be harmful...

535
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:58,743
and any misuses, however slight,
will end your art privileges.

536
00:43:58,745 --> 00:44:03,882
Now, who here has experience
with the art of photography?

537
00:44:32,648 --> 00:44:34,215
Anna.

538
00:44:34,217 --> 00:44:38,619
Someone broke into the principal's
house and stole all the alcohol.

539
00:44:38,621 --> 00:44:40,621
Do you know who might
have done this?

540
00:44:57,408 --> 00:44:59,142
House Mother, you're
talking to someone...

541
00:44:59,144 --> 00:45:03,513
who takes the harmful effects
of alcohol very seriously.

542
00:45:03,515 --> 00:45:06,149
Drinking is the
Devil's calling card.

543
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:18,195
Hey, Anna, look.

544
00:45:19,699 --> 00:45:22,367
I'm so, so sorry about
the closet. I...

545
00:45:22,369 --> 00:45:24,970
Oh, don't worry about it.

546
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:29,307
Some friends are coming over to tea
tomorrow. Do you want to join us?

547
00:45:29,309 --> 00:45:31,711
Can Megan come?

548
00:45:31,713 --> 00:45:35,047
What, Mousey? She's such a retard.

549
00:45:35,049 --> 00:45:36,916
Yeah, she is.

550
00:45:53,635 --> 00:45:57,472
Do you copy your roses from
the rose bushes out there?

551
00:45:57,474 --> 00:46:00,008
Roses don't grow during the winter.

552
00:46:02,344 --> 00:46:06,548
Sometimes we remember things the way we want
to, rather than the way they really were.

553
00:46:06,550 --> 00:46:11,554
I didn't do anything to those girls,
if that's what you're implying.

554
00:46:11,556 --> 00:46:17,193
False memories can have a... a
rushed feeling to them...

555
00:46:17,195 --> 00:46:19,128
a lack of detail.

556
00:46:19,130 --> 00:46:23,466
The windows won't have views or
none of the clocks will work.

557
00:46:23,468 --> 00:46:27,804
Well, if you ever find me, ah,
particularly attractive in a memory...

558
00:46:27,806 --> 00:46:30,240
it's probably because
I'm making it up, too.

559
00:46:30,242 --> 00:46:34,111
I wouldn't picture myself having a bad
skin day if I knew you'd be around.

560
00:46:34,113 --> 00:46:37,982
Hey, I'm not kidding, okay?

561
00:46:37,984 --> 00:46:40,384
I can accept we don't exactly
know what we're looking for...

562
00:46:40,386 --> 00:46:42,353
but your memories have to be real!

563
00:46:42,355 --> 00:46:43,921
You have to be very careful!

564
00:46:43,923 --> 00:46:45,856
Has something told you
I've been making them up?

565
00:46:45,858 --> 00:46:49,661
Yeah, I saw a clock on the wall,
the hands weren't moving.

566
00:46:49,663 --> 00:46:52,364
The one in the dorm hallway, right?

567
00:46:52,366 --> 00:46:54,166
Yeah.

568
00:46:54,168 --> 00:46:56,735
That one never worked.

569
00:46:56,737 --> 00:47:01,107
We used to call our gym teacher, Mr. Pierce
"The Clock", because he didn't work, either.

570
00:47:18,226 --> 00:47:20,661
You never leave the house, right?

571
00:47:24,333 --> 00:47:26,067
Not anymore.

572
00:48:09,181 --> 00:48:11,416
You've got 20 minutes.

573
00:48:21,961 --> 00:48:24,129
Mr. Ortega?

574
00:48:24,131 --> 00:48:27,634
So, what are you?
Some kind of therapist?

575
00:48:27,636 --> 00:48:30,970
Do you know what a
memory detective is?

576
00:48:32,206 --> 00:48:35,075
Somebody who takes
rich people's money.

577
00:48:35,077 --> 00:48:36,943
Well, that's me.

578
00:48:36,945 --> 00:48:40,848
Has Anna's family hired you to
find out if she has a soul?

579
00:48:40,850 --> 00:48:43,284
I'm just here to
find out the truth.

580
00:48:43,286 --> 00:48:46,854
That family is a nightmare.

581
00:48:46,856 --> 00:48:49,590
You dig too deep,
better watch your step.

582
00:48:49,592 --> 00:48:53,028
You're lucky you didn't get 20
years for seducing a minor.

583
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:57,899
I'm not saying I wasn't at
fault, but that girl...

584
00:48:57,901 --> 00:49:03,905
that girl was everywhere I
turned... flirting...

585
00:49:03,907 --> 00:49:09,712
finding ways to get us alone.

586
00:49:09,714 --> 00:49:11,948
I've lost everything.

587
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:16,987
My job, my fiance, my freedom...

588
00:49:16,989 --> 00:49:22,126
my entire fucking
life, because of her.

589
00:49:22,128 --> 00:49:25,462
Anna's family throws money
around like confetti.

590
00:49:25,464 --> 00:49:27,631
They can get to anybody.

591
00:49:27,633 --> 00:49:30,802
Cops, district attorneys...

592
00:49:30,804 --> 00:49:34,372
They've covered up all the
bad stuff Anna's done.

593
00:49:34,374 --> 00:49:38,643
Then, had me thrown in here
for something I didn't do.

594
00:49:38,645 --> 00:49:42,915
I'm sure that they even covered
it up when she tried to kill...

595
00:49:42,917 --> 00:49:46,152
those three girls at
school that same year.

596
00:49:46,154 --> 00:49:49,422
Anna blamed it all on
another girl, Mousey...

597
00:49:49,424 --> 00:49:52,425
but no one could find
out who she was.

598
00:49:52,427 --> 00:49:58,064
Not even Susan Merrick s family
was able to take Anna to court.

599
00:49:58,066 --> 00:50:02,369
I'd love that family to finally
get what's coming to them.

600
00:50:24,794 --> 00:50:26,862
Susan Merrick?

601
00:50:29,432 --> 00:50:33,736
My name is John Washington. Can I ask
you a few questions about Anna Greene?

602
00:50:33,738 --> 00:50:37,540
Are you a cop?

603
00:50:37,542 --> 00:50:39,742
No, I'm not a cop, Ms. Merrick.

604
00:50:39,744 --> 00:50:41,478
What? Has she died or something?

605
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:43,646
No... not at all.

606
00:50:43,648 --> 00:50:48,819
I just want to find out what happened, what
really happened at the Whitten Academy.

607
00:50:48,821 --> 00:50:51,489
You think Anna was responsible.

608
00:50:51,491 --> 00:50:54,859
Of course, she was a total psycho.

609
00:50:54,861 --> 00:50:58,597
There were a lot of other girls there
with problems. Could have been anyone.

610
00:50:58,599 --> 00:51:00,899
I got on with everyone.

611
00:51:00,901 --> 00:51:04,669
Did you have a girl named
Mousey at your school?

612
00:51:04,671 --> 00:51:08,707
No... I don't think so.

613
00:51:08,709 --> 00:51:10,309
Now, I'm sorry, but I have to go.

614
00:51:10,311 --> 00:51:12,378
Miss Merrick, I know what
you've been through.

615
00:51:13,714 --> 00:51:16,249
I know it must have
been extremely painful.

616
00:51:16,251 --> 00:51:19,552
I really need your help.

617
00:51:19,554 --> 00:51:23,123
Do you have any specific memory
of Anna you think I should know?

618
00:51:24,926 --> 00:51:28,495
Yeah... sure I do.

619
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:08,238
Anna seriously has balls. She was like
"drinking is the Devil's calling card".

620
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:10,073
It was awesome.

621
00:52:13,478 --> 00:52:17,748
Hey, Anna, do you want a cup?

622
00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:19,150
No, thanks.

623
00:52:19,152 --> 00:52:20,685
You sure?

624
00:52:20,687 --> 00:52:23,054
Yeah.

625
00:52:29,462 --> 00:52:31,196
I like you being here with us.

626
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:27,157
And coming back... now.

627
00:53:37,301 --> 00:53:41,773
You saw Mousey, right? She did it.

628
00:53:41,775 --> 00:53:45,810
So you didn't poison those girls?
Of course, not.

629
00:53:47,279 --> 00:53:52,584
Your prints were all over the teapot.
Because I picked it up once or twice.

630
00:53:52,586 --> 00:53:55,954
And why would I wipe the poison clean,
but leave my prints on the teapot?

631
00:53:55,956 --> 00:53:59,358
Not to mention hiding the
poison under my bed.

632
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:02,061
Maybe you're too smart
for your own good.

633
00:54:02,063 --> 00:54:04,064
If you'd wiped the pot,
that would point to you.

634
00:54:04,066 --> 00:54:08,001
Maybe you just didn't have
time to hide the poison.

635
00:54:08,003 --> 00:54:10,070
It was Megan, John.

636
00:54:11,072 --> 00:54:13,139
Why didn't you go to the cops?

637
00:54:13,141 --> 00:54:16,911
What, and tell them that Megan was obsessed
and that she smirked at me as I was led away?

638
00:54:16,913 --> 00:54:18,579
Why not?

639
00:54:18,581 --> 00:54:21,082
You're forgetting what it's
like to be a teenager.

640
00:54:21,084 --> 00:54:25,352
Adults telling you what to do, having opinion
about what you say, before you even say it.

641
00:54:25,354 --> 00:54:29,257
There's no Mousey, Anna.
What?

642
00:54:29,259 --> 00:54:31,960
What are you talking about?
There's no Megan at the school.

643
00:54:31,962 --> 00:54:34,730
Oh, you don't believe me?
Do you blame me?

644
00:54:34,732 --> 00:54:40,068
Megan transferred in during the second
semester and left right after I got expelled.

645
00:54:40,070 --> 00:54:41,470
You know, who the hell
do you think I am?

646
00:54:41,472 --> 00:54:42,939
Please tell me, John!

647
00:54:42,941 --> 00:54:44,674
What... what, you think
I'm some psychopath?

648
00:54:44,676 --> 00:54:47,376
What? This is the second day in
a row you've called me a liar!

649
00:54:47,378 --> 00:54:50,113
I want to know why you're
suddenly turning on me!

650
00:54:51,415 --> 00:54:54,017
Here! My yearbook!

651
00:54:54,019 --> 00:54:55,519
Asshole.

652
00:55:10,302 --> 00:55:13,238
You won't mind if I hang on
to this for a couple of days?

653
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:16,007
Sleep with it under your
pillow, for all I care.

654
00:55:16,009 --> 00:55:17,842
We don't have much time.

655
00:55:17,844 --> 00:55:22,548
I want you to think about all the key
moments in your life by tomorrow.

656
00:55:22,550 --> 00:55:24,250
Can you do that for me?

657
00:55:25,252 --> 00:55:26,585
Fine.

658
00:56:34,695 --> 00:56:36,394
John...

659
00:56:36,396 --> 00:56:38,296
John, Why don't you help me?

660
00:56:38,298 --> 00:56:40,665
Why don't you wanna help me?

661
00:56:40,667 --> 00:56:42,267
Mom!

662
00:56:43,904 --> 00:56:50,409
This old man, he played three.

663
00:56:50,411 --> 00:56:54,313
He played knick-knack on my knee.

664
00:56:54,315 --> 00:56:56,315
With a knick-knack paddy whack...

665
00:56:56,317 --> 00:56:58,784
give a dog a bone, this old...

666
00:56:58,786 --> 00:57:01,221
Who's there?

667
00:57:23,779 --> 00:57:24,914
Anna?

668
00:57:28,518 --> 00:57:29,852
Anna!

669
00:57:37,062 --> 00:57:38,662
Hello?

670
00:58:34,622 --> 00:58:37,925
Hey!

671
00:58:37,927 --> 00:58:39,260
Wait!

672
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:53,309
Wait!

673
00:59:16,334 --> 00:59:18,002
Is there somewhere
I can freshen up?

674
00:59:18,004 --> 00:59:21,139
There's a bathroom just down
that corridor on your left.

675
00:59:21,141 --> 00:59:22,740
Oh, thank you.

676
01:01:05,218 --> 01:01:09,556
What are you doing in here?

677
01:01:09,558 --> 01:01:12,159
Maybe I'm looking for the
guy from last night.

678
01:01:14,862 --> 01:01:20,233
You know, Mr. Greene, it really isn't
necessary to have me followed.

679
01:01:20,235 --> 01:01:23,504
I had you extensively looked
into before you were hired.

680
01:01:23,506 --> 01:01:26,107
I don't have anyone
following you now.

681
01:01:26,109 --> 01:01:30,811
And now, if you'd be so kind, your
work in this house is upstairs.

682
01:02:27,174 --> 01:02:29,008
Very nice, Anna.

683
01:02:31,511 --> 01:02:34,680
Not just yet.

684
01:03:17,762 --> 01:03:20,630
Glad you're back from zombie land.

685
01:03:20,632 --> 01:03:23,199
You okay, want some water?

686
01:03:27,806 --> 01:03:31,609
Aren't they great?
Better than what you had before.

687
01:03:32,911 --> 01:03:34,445
How did you do that?

688
01:03:34,447 --> 01:03:36,714
I just downloaded it.

689
01:03:36,716 --> 01:03:39,016
No, how did you leave
me alone in the memory?

690
01:03:39,018 --> 01:03:41,219
I don't know.

691
01:03:41,221 --> 01:03:45,691
Suddenly I was back here, and our hands
were separated, but you were still under.

692
01:03:45,693 --> 01:03:48,126
I wasn't sure what to do.

693
01:03:52,700 --> 01:03:55,234
You looked cute while
you were sleeping.

694
01:04:04,713 --> 01:04:08,082
Anna, do you know
what transference is?

695
01:04:09,150 --> 01:04:10,718
I do.

696
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:12,820
Then you'll know it's
perfectly natural to...

697
01:04:12,822 --> 01:04:16,490
To what? Have strong feelings
for your therapist?

698
01:04:16,492 --> 01:04:19,594
I just simply said I liked
watching you sleep.

699
01:04:21,063 --> 01:04:23,832
Your teacher was a lot older
than you, he took advantage.

700
01:04:23,834 --> 01:04:28,002
He was encouraging... that
place was so depressing.

701
01:04:28,004 --> 01:04:30,039
What about the photos?

702
01:04:30,041 --> 01:04:33,743
He said they were for art, and
at first they were artistic.

703
01:06:07,778 --> 01:06:09,546
You okay? You don't look too good.

704
01:06:09,548 --> 01:06:11,982
I'm having trouble
staying grounded.

705
01:06:11,984 --> 01:06:14,551
Side-effects from the sessions?
Hallucinations?

706
01:06:14,553 --> 01:06:18,222
Yeah... terrible headaches. I
can't sleep... nightmares.

707
01:06:18,224 --> 01:06:21,860
Plus the guy they've hired to follow me...
he's... he is everywhere I go.

708
01:06:21,862 --> 01:06:27,565
Maybe events have made this case far bigger
than you were ready for when you started.

709
01:06:27,567 --> 01:06:29,667
Maybe we should ask
Lundgren to take over.

710
01:06:29,669 --> 01:06:32,871
No! No way, no.
I can handle it.

711
01:06:35,442 --> 01:06:38,244
Did you ever treat
Anna at their house?

712
01:06:38,246 --> 01:06:39,578
No.

713
01:06:39,580 --> 01:06:42,781
Did you ever have reason to
suspect abuse within the family?

714
01:06:42,783 --> 01:06:44,316
Nothing with the stepfather?

715
01:06:44,318 --> 01:06:48,154
Highly unlikely. I mean, look,
Robert's a prominent guy.

716
01:06:48,156 --> 01:06:51,491
I wouldn't go down that
road based on a hunch.

717
01:06:51,493 --> 01:06:54,327
Tom Ortega told me Anna's
parents set him up for...

718
01:06:54,329 --> 01:06:57,097
You went to see Tom Ortega?

719
01:06:57,099 --> 01:06:59,867
That lowlife took dirty
pictures of Anna.

720
01:06:59,869 --> 01:07:03,037
You should be focusing on the sessions,
not investigating in the real world.

721
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:04,805
You need to be objective, John.

722
01:07:04,807 --> 01:07:08,776
There is something going on
there behind the scenes...

723
01:07:08,778 --> 01:07:10,444
I need to find out what it is.

724
01:07:10,446 --> 01:07:13,782
You need to consider that this job
is too big and too complex...

725
01:07:13,784 --> 01:07:16,184
and that you are becoming
too personally involved.

726
01:07:16,186 --> 01:07:19,187
Whatever it is, I'm gonna
find out the truth.

727
01:07:47,986 --> 01:07:50,322
Do you know where you want to go?

728
01:07:50,324 --> 01:07:55,126
I went through all the photos and
one of them made me feel something.

729
01:07:55,128 --> 01:07:56,328
Don't tell me.

730
01:07:56,330 --> 01:07:58,797
Don't corrupt the
memory, just go there.

731
01:08:03,236 --> 01:08:07,106
When you're ready, close your eyes.

732
01:08:09,309 --> 01:08:13,212
Let's begin... now.

733
01:08:17,986 --> 01:08:20,721
My parents brought him to me.
Who?

734
01:08:20,723 --> 01:08:22,389
I don't remember his name.

735
01:08:31,834 --> 01:08:35,203
This old man, he played three.

736
01:08:35,205 --> 01:08:38,139
He played knick-knack on my knee.

737
01:08:38,141 --> 01:08:42,511
With a knick-knack paddy whack,
give a dog a bone.

738
01:08:42,513 --> 01:08:46,682
This old man came rolling home.

739
01:09:08,740 --> 01:09:11,275
What are you doing
over there, Anna?

740
01:09:12,878 --> 01:09:16,882
Why don't you come here...
next to me.

741
01:09:18,418 --> 01:09:21,219
Come here, sweetheart.

742
01:09:31,832 --> 01:09:33,032
Don't be afraid.

743
01:09:35,003 --> 01:09:38,971
I won't hurt you.

744
01:09:38,973 --> 01:09:41,207
And coming back... now!

745
01:09:46,247 --> 01:09:47,548
Anna?

746
01:09:48,951 --> 01:09:50,284
Anna, can you hear me?

747
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:52,653
You're okay, you fainted.

748
01:09:52,655 --> 01:09:53,921
What happened?

749
01:09:53,923 --> 01:09:56,357
Can you get some water. She's okay.

750
01:09:56,359 --> 01:09:58,993
Yeah, sure.

751
01:10:02,698 --> 01:10:04,632
Take this.

752
01:10:04,634 --> 01:10:06,702
What is it?

753
01:10:06,704 --> 01:10:11,040
It's a bit of one of your mom's
sedatives. It'll help you sleep.

754
01:10:18,048 --> 01:10:20,350
So, what happens now?

755
01:10:20,352 --> 01:10:24,688
Now... you get better.

756
01:10:41,507 --> 01:10:46,145
This is the key to the house my
parents lived in when I was born.

757
01:10:46,147 --> 01:10:49,047
I always felt safe there.

758
01:10:49,049 --> 01:10:51,884
So many times in my life
people have been unkind.

759
01:10:51,886 --> 01:10:55,754
I can't thank you enough, John.

760
01:10:55,756 --> 01:10:59,692
Will you keep this
with you at all times?

761
01:10:59,694 --> 01:11:02,796
If I know you have it, then at least I
know that there's someone out there...

762
01:11:02,798 --> 01:11:04,464
who's on my side.

763
01:11:04,466 --> 01:11:07,767
I might not be going
to an institution...

764
01:11:07,769 --> 01:11:10,671
but I still feel trapped.

765
01:11:10,673 --> 01:11:12,239
Sure.

766
01:11:29,425 --> 01:11:32,194
Hey! Hey!

767
01:11:35,766 --> 01:11:38,968
John? What are you doing here? You should
have called, I've got dinner guests.

768
01:11:38,970 --> 01:11:40,803
Why Sebastian?

769
01:11:40,805 --> 01:11:42,939
Christ! She was just a child.

770
01:11:42,941 --> 01:11:45,208
What's going on?
You've been drinking?

771
01:11:46,343 --> 01:11:51,415
These were in Anna's memories.
Have you been in my office?

772
01:11:51,417 --> 01:11:55,519
I've seen you with her, in the
library, in one of the memories.

773
01:11:55,521 --> 01:11:57,888
Oh, I might have been
there once, I forgot!

774
01:11:57,890 --> 01:11:59,791
What's this all about?

775
01:11:59,793 --> 01:12:03,361
You said you never treated her at
the house, but you were there!

776
01:12:04,964 --> 01:12:07,899
Are you trying to say I
did something to her?

777
01:12:07,901 --> 01:12:09,901
Think this through, John.

778
01:12:09,903 --> 01:12:15,107
Why would I ask you to take on a
case, if I was guilty of something?

779
01:12:15,109 --> 01:12:17,309
Think about what it is
you're accusing me of...

780
01:12:17,311 --> 01:12:21,247
then, think about who
it is you're accusing.

781
01:12:21,249 --> 01:12:23,249
They wanted to hire Peter Lundgren.

782
01:12:23,251 --> 01:12:26,386
You brought me in, because I
was down, and I was weak...

783
01:12:26,388 --> 01:12:29,489
and I was easy to manipulate.
Right?

784
01:12:29,491 --> 01:12:32,993
And you wouldn't let me see that
file until you absolutely had to.

785
01:12:32,995 --> 01:12:36,196
You said they didn't want me to see
it, but you had it the whole time!

786
01:12:36,198 --> 01:12:38,432
I never told you I
didn't have the file!

787
01:12:38,434 --> 01:12:41,602
I said the family wanted privacy.

788
01:12:41,604 --> 01:12:44,238
What about the other day? Ah?
You wanted me to drop the case.

789
01:12:44,240 --> 01:12:45,840
I said that because...

790
01:12:45,842 --> 01:12:48,442
Now... I know what you didn't
want me to find out.

791
01:12:48,444 --> 01:12:50,946
I said that because I
was worried about you!

792
01:12:50,948 --> 01:12:54,383
Oh, c'mon, John!

793
01:12:54,385 --> 01:12:57,352
You've been drinking alone.
Having hallucinations for days!

794
01:12:57,354 --> 01:12:59,688
You're ignoring me
again, Uncle Sebastian

795
01:12:59,690 --> 01:13:01,290
Hi, sweetheart.

796
01:13:02,459 --> 01:13:05,128
Sorry. John...

797
01:13:05,130 --> 01:13:09,699
Don't you ever go near
Anna again! You hear me?

798
01:13:12,836 --> 01:13:15,539
John!

799
01:13:15,541 --> 01:13:16,807
John!

800
01:13:20,378 --> 01:13:23,647
Due to Anna's early
overt sexualization...

801
01:13:23,649 --> 01:13:25,282
she has a need for control...

802
01:13:25,284 --> 01:13:28,887
which manifests itself in
a variety of disorders.

803
01:13:28,889 --> 01:13:31,489
She has... significant
difficulty...

804
01:13:31,491 --> 01:13:36,328
in forming and maintaining long-term
relationships with others.

805
01:13:36,330 --> 01:13:38,663
Basically, she has developed
a protective shell...

806
01:13:38,665 --> 01:13:40,166
Do you like it?
Which keeps out the pain...

807
01:13:40,168 --> 01:13:43,836
and keeps out everything else.
It's great.

808
01:13:43,838 --> 01:13:47,440
She interacts with the world in a completely
different way than the way we do.

809
01:13:47,442 --> 01:13:50,676
Locking her up is the worst
possible thing you could do.

810
01:13:56,551 --> 01:14:00,554
Thank you so much, Mr.
Washington.

811
01:14:00,556 --> 01:14:02,589
Good luck.

812
01:15:06,526 --> 01:15:09,796
<i>It's not your fault, John.</i>

813
01:15:12,900 --> 01:15:15,735
<i>This person...
they lied about everything.</i>

814
01:15:15,737 --> 01:15:19,506
<i>But just because the lies are shocking
and they attract a lot of attention...</i>

815
01:15:19,508 --> 01:15:22,209
it doesn't necessarily
make them true.

816
01:15:22,211 --> 01:15:24,578
It was very important for us to...

817
01:15:24,580 --> 01:15:27,181
<i>to check the facts and
to question the facts...</i>

818
01:15:27,183 --> 01:15:29,516
until it was evident
that I was innocent.

819
01:15:29,518 --> 01:15:33,555
<i>And once we've proven my innocence,
we went back to that proof...</i>

820
01:15:33,557 --> 01:15:36,991
<i>over and over again, and looked</i>
<i>at it with a fresh set of eyes.</i>

821
01:15:36,993 --> 01:15:41,362
<i>Because only then, were we able
to actually see the truth.</i>

822
01:15:41,364 --> 01:15:43,865
<i>Are there any questions?</i>

823
01:15:43,867 --> 01:15:45,634
How does it feel to be designated?

824
01:15:45,636 --> 01:15:47,403
<i>That's a good question...</i>

825
01:15:47,405 --> 01:15:48,938
<i>and I just want to thank
my constituency...</i>

826
01:17:06,455 --> 01:17:09,624
I just downloaded it.

827
01:17:09,626 --> 01:17:12,395
Aren't they great? Better
than what you had before.

828
01:17:49,503 --> 01:17:51,937
Hello?
<i>Can you come over?</i>

829
01:17:51,939 --> 01:17:53,138
I need to see you, John.

830
01:17:53,140 --> 01:17:54,306
Anna, look, I need to talk to...

831
01:17:54,308 --> 01:17:56,242
Before it's too late!

832
01:17:56,244 --> 01:17:58,244
<i>Something terrible has
happened and I need to...</i>

833
01:17:58,246 --> 01:18:02,616
What?
Hello?

834
01:18:02,618 --> 01:18:04,918
Hello?

835
01:18:08,790 --> 01:18:10,957
<i>You have reached the
Greene's residence.</i>

836
01:18:10,959 --> 01:18:14,094
<i>Please leave a message and we'll get
back to you as soon as we can.</i>

837
01:18:56,442 --> 01:18:59,543
Hello?

838
01:19:37,418 --> 01:19:40,187
Anna?
<i>John.</i>

839
01:20:25,905 --> 01:20:28,005
Hey!

840
01:20:28,007 --> 01:20:29,940
Open the door!

841
01:20:29,942 --> 01:20:34,146
<i>John, there's someone in our house!</i>

842
01:20:41,587 --> 01:20:44,791
Shit!

843
01:20:44,793 --> 01:20:48,194
Mom? Mom?

844
01:20:48,196 --> 01:20:49,495
Hello?

845
01:20:49,497 --> 01:20:50,630
<i>Wh... emergency...</i>

846
01:20:50,632 --> 01:20:51,764
Hello, can you hear me?

847
01:20:56,170 --> 01:20:57,671
Shit.

848
01:20:57,673 --> 01:20:59,193
<i>I don't want to die!</i>

849
01:21:17,293 --> 01:21:22,131
Hey! Hey! Open the goddamn door!

850
01:22:07,615 --> 01:22:10,048
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

851
01:22:10,050 --> 01:22:13,386
I'm at 1103 Bayside.

852
01:22:13,388 --> 01:22:17,724
I have an intruder and
a serious assault.

853
01:22:17,726 --> 01:22:19,392
Okay, that's right.

854
01:22:19,394 --> 01:22:22,495
We already have multiple units
responding to that address, sir.

855
01:22:44,186 --> 01:22:45,320
Anna!

856
01:22:47,056 --> 01:22:48,823
Wait!

857
01:23:01,572 --> 01:23:03,840
Anna!

858
01:23:19,124 --> 01:23:21,626
John.

859
01:23:21,628 --> 01:23:26,064
Anna! You okay? You hurt?

860
01:23:29,302 --> 01:23:31,136
Look, we're being followed...

861
01:23:31,138 --> 01:23:35,674
but the police are here, you stay
with me you're gonna be safe. Okay?

862
01:23:39,180 --> 01:23:41,014
I'm sorry.

863
01:23:43,784 --> 01:23:44,784
What?

864
01:23:45,887 --> 01:23:48,054
There's something over there!

865
01:23:52,561 --> 01:23:56,297
Hey! Hey!

866
01:23:56,299 --> 01:23:57,999
Over here!

867
01:24:03,338 --> 01:24:04,940
Hey! Stop! Stop!

868
01:24:04,942 --> 01:24:06,942
Hey! Somebody's broken into
the Greene's house!

869
01:24:06,944 --> 01:24:08,510
Police!
I'm pretty su...

870
01:24:08,512 --> 01:24:10,245
Stay where you are!
Stay right where you are!

871
01:24:10,247 --> 01:24:15,984
Hands up, Mr. Washington!
Hands up, Mr. Washington!

872
01:24:45,351 --> 01:24:48,753
You're suspected of
murder, Mr. Washington.

873
01:24:52,091 --> 01:24:55,494
We found hundreds of pictures
featuring underage girls...

874
01:24:55,496 --> 01:24:58,197
in your computer.

875
01:24:58,199 --> 01:24:59,699
She set me up.

876
01:24:59,701 --> 01:25:04,503
A 16 year-old girl.

877
01:25:04,505 --> 01:25:09,743
Look. We know the parents were constantly
threatening to send the girl to an institution...

878
01:25:09,745 --> 01:25:12,012
and that you... strongly
disagreed with that.

879
01:25:12,014 --> 01:25:15,248
So the way I see it, you
got too close to the girl.

880
01:25:15,250 --> 01:25:17,751
You drugged the parents, so
you could take her away...

881
01:25:17,753 --> 01:25:22,890
but she refused to go and you end up doing
something you'd never think you were capable of.

882
01:25:22,892 --> 01:25:24,692
The parents are okay?

883
01:25:24,694 --> 01:25:29,864
Yeah... we found the mother's
sleeping pills in the kitchen, John.

884
01:25:29,866 --> 01:25:34,903
And I'd be willing to bet that your fingerprints
are all over that prescription bottle.

885
01:25:34,905 --> 01:25:37,606
We found a letter opener,
covered in blood...

886
01:25:37,608 --> 01:25:40,909
in the forest, where you were.

887
01:25:40,911 --> 01:25:43,645
I can explain every peace of
evidence you think you have.

888
01:25:43,647 --> 01:25:49,052
We're carefully going through
the tapes of you chasing Anna.

889
01:25:49,054 --> 01:25:50,987
Now obviously you disabled
a number of the cameras...

890
01:25:50,989 --> 01:25:53,590
and then turned the power
off to cover your tracks.

891
01:25:53,592 --> 01:25:57,928
I was locked inside the
surveillance room!

892
01:26:02,567 --> 01:26:04,568
Recognize this?

893
01:26:06,271 --> 01:26:08,072
Anna gave me that.

894
01:26:11,244 --> 01:26:15,413
It's the key to the
surveillance room.

895
01:26:16,883 --> 01:26:19,351
You panicked, needed an alibi...

896
01:26:19,353 --> 01:26:23,823
so you damaged the interior of
the door, but you forgot...

897
01:26:23,825 --> 01:26:28,461
that you had the key
in your pocket.

898
01:26:28,463 --> 01:26:31,063
Do the right thing, John...

899
01:26:31,065 --> 01:26:34,033
and tell me what you
did with the girl.

900
01:26:34,035 --> 01:26:37,738
I went to the house,
I was looking for her.

901
01:26:37,740 --> 01:26:40,140
And you got locked in
the surveillance room.

902
01:26:40,142 --> 01:26:43,043
Exactly. And when I got out,
it was too late.

903
01:26:43,045 --> 01:26:48,016
And there was blood on the floor in the
hallway, I followed the trail to the forest!

904
01:26:48,018 --> 01:26:50,218
- And that's how you got the
blood on your shoes? - Yes.

905
01:26:50,220 --> 01:26:55,089
By following the trail of blood from a
16 year-old... in a massive forest.

906
01:26:55,091 --> 01:26:59,595
Yes, and... she came
out of nowhere.

907
01:26:59,597 --> 01:27:05,935
She... she grabbed my hands, my
hands had blood on them.

908
01:27:05,937 --> 01:27:09,338
She ran away.

909
01:27:09,340 --> 01:27:12,142
And was this before or after
she called 911 on her cell...

910
01:27:12,144 --> 01:27:17,347
screaming and crying that you were chasing
her through the house, trying to kill her?

911
01:27:17,349 --> 01:27:19,649
There is plenty of
evidence to convict you.

912
01:27:19,651 --> 01:27:23,653
There was someone else there.

913
01:27:23,655 --> 01:27:26,424
You're gonna die in jail.

914
01:27:40,941 --> 01:27:44,877
And coming back... now.

915
01:28:07,702 --> 01:28:11,572
<i>End of move, end of move!</i>

916
01:28:18,080 --> 01:28:19,547
Okay, that's it.

917
01:28:19,549 --> 01:28:22,517
We visited all the necessary
memories together...

918
01:28:22,519 --> 01:28:27,490
through every aspect of your
involvement in Anna's case.

919
01:28:27,492 --> 01:28:30,226
I should have realized
what she was doing.

920
01:28:30,228 --> 01:28:32,495
It's not your fault, John.

921
01:28:32,497 --> 01:28:35,898
Anna was able to study our protocols
during your time with her...

922
01:28:35,900 --> 01:28:39,703
and she eventually became strong enough
to control and manipulate the sessions.

923
01:28:39,705 --> 01:28:46,143
She was even able to figure out that water
triggered the memories of your wife's suicide.

924
01:28:46,145 --> 01:28:48,545
She needed you to be
responsible for her death.

925
01:28:48,547 --> 01:28:53,384
If she just ran away, her parents
would just keep searching for her.

926
01:28:53,386 --> 01:28:56,054
Did you find anything?

927
01:28:56,056 --> 01:28:58,156
I'll submit our sessions
to the judge...

928
01:28:58,158 --> 01:29:01,392
specifically highlighting the time you
were locked in the surveillance room...

929
01:29:01,394 --> 01:29:03,561
and when you spoke to
her in the forest...

930
01:29:03,563 --> 01:29:07,466
but as you know, our sessions don't
yet carry the same weight...

931
01:29:07,468 --> 01:29:09,969
as eye witness testimony in court.

932
01:29:09,971 --> 01:29:14,540
The only irrefutable evidence you could
have is proving Anna's still out there...

933
01:29:14,542 --> 01:29:18,511
but... that's something
beyond my capabilities.

934
01:29:20,582 --> 01:29:23,116
Mr. Lundgren?

935
01:29:45,675 --> 01:29:48,210
I'm so sorry.

936
01:29:48,212 --> 01:29:52,147
I don't know how she
made me believe her.

937
01:29:52,149 --> 01:29:54,650
She had me completely fooled.

938
01:29:58,222 --> 01:30:00,490
It's all good, John.

939
01:30:00,492 --> 01:30:03,459
You've been under a lot
of pressure lately.

940
01:30:03,461 --> 01:30:05,261
Thank you.

941
01:30:05,263 --> 01:30:09,400
The judge is gonna consider
Peter's testimony for sure...

942
01:30:09,402 --> 01:30:11,535
but since you both
work for Mindscape...

943
01:30:11,537 --> 01:30:15,539
there are some legal issues we need
to get over and that'll take time.

944
01:30:15,541 --> 01:30:16,807
I know.

945
01:30:16,809 --> 01:30:20,211
Now... the sooner you get rid
of the house the better.

946
01:30:20,213 --> 01:30:23,448
It won't take long before
the bail will be granted.

947
01:30:23,450 --> 01:30:26,751
But don't worry, John,
you're not alone.

948
01:30:26,753 --> 01:30:30,855
I'm gonna do everything in my power
to help you get clear of this.

949
01:31:05,761 --> 01:31:09,298
And you just want to
send a single rose?

950
01:31:09,300 --> 01:31:13,735
A single rose and...
this photograph.

951
01:31:17,807 --> 01:31:21,978
Would you be so kind as to remove all
the thorns, before sending it over?

952
01:31:21,980 --> 01:31:24,814
You can count on it, yeah.

953
01:31:44,035 --> 01:31:46,103
<i>The funny thing about memory...</i>

954
01:31:46,105 --> 01:31:48,840
is that it can't be fully trusted.

955
01:31:55,848 --> 01:32:01,921
<i>And yet, in the end, it's
the only truth we have.</i>

956
01:32:01,923 --> 01:32:07,126
<i>And no matter how painful it is,
you gotta look at the truth...</i>

957
01:32:07,128 --> 01:32:09,495
because sometimes...

958
01:32:09,497 --> 01:32:12,599
it's the only thing
that can save you.

959
01:32:15,870 --> 01:32:18,105
It's the only thing...

960
01:32:18,107 --> 01:32:21,241
that can set you free.

961
01:32:39,896 --> 01:32:42,932
I just thought I'd...

962
01:32:42,934 --> 01:32:45,467
try to come up so you could say no.

963
01:32:47,137 --> 01:32:49,206
Come in.
